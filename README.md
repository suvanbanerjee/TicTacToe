# Tic Tac Toe

This is a very simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) (Or anything you want), and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features
- Easy-to-understand command-line interface.
- Two players can play against each other.
- The game detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- Supports input validation to prevent invalid moves.

## Why the most  generic game
I'm on a coding journey, and by this project I want to dive into the world of coding conventions and proper practices. It was awsome learning experience! I made sure to keep my code nice and consice, giving everything meaningful names and comments moreover getting from -30 to +7 in pylint was cool ^_^ , if you ever feel like taking a break and playing some Tic-Tac-Toe, give it a shot! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it.
